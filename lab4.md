    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig11.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Pre-built project with event tracing feature enabled</i>
    </p>

6. Uncheck** the _Generate SD card image_ check box as it is already generated in the imported project.
### Analyze the source code with the tracing code included in the sharpen_filter stub.
1. Open SDSoC_lab_design_main.c from the {_labs}\lab4b\Debug_sds\swstubs_directory.
2. Change the number of times the algorithm loops over is changed from 5 to 1.

	This is to reduce the amount of trace data collected and to give a better view of state analysis.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig12.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Loop iteration changed to 1</i>
    </p>	
	
	Notice that the call to the _rgb\_2\_gray_ is replaced by the call to the stub.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig13.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Hardware function call</i>
    </p>

3. Double-click on the **rgb\_2\_gray.c** entry under the _Debug/\_sds/swstubs_ directory and notice the actual call is updated.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig14.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>The rgb_2_gray function having sds_trace function calls</i>
    </p>

	The stub function initializes the hardware accelerator, initiates any required data transfers for the function arguments, and then synchronizes hardware and software by waiting at an appropriate point in the program for the accelerator and all associated data transfers to complete.

	Event tracing provides visibility into each phase of the hardware function execution, including the software setup for the accelerators and data transfers, as well as the hardware execution of the accelerators and data transfers.

	The above code is instrumented for trace. Each command that starts the accelerator, starts a transfer, or waits for a transfer to complete is instrumented (sds_trace(xxxx, EVENT_START | EVENT_STOP); ).

### Run the application and collect the trace data.
1. Connect and power ON the board.
2. Right-click on the lab4b project and select Run As &gt; Trace Application (SDx Application Debugger)****.

	This will download the bitstream, then the application and finally run the application.

	Notice in the SDx Log tab that the trace data is exported.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig15.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Exporting trace data</i>
    </p>

	When the trace data export is completed, the tool will create a trace folder named lab4b_Traces in the Project Explorer tab.

	A new tab, AXI State View, is created next to the Memory tab.

### View the AXI State to analyze the application flow.
1. Expand the lab4b_Traces project folder in the Project Explorer tab .
2. Expand all the folders under the Traces[1] folder.

    <i>Trace Visualization Highlighting the Different Types of Events – Stub Code Comparison</i>
    </p>

4. Hover the cursor above one of the events.

	Each trace point in the user application is given a unique name and axis, or swimlane, on the timeline.

	Each trace event has a few different attributes, such as name, type, start time, stop time, and duration.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig18.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Detailed Information Available for Each Event</i>
    </p>

5. Click on the previous/next event button (![alt tag](./images/lab4/trace_tool_buttons.png)) to see the start. Zoom out appropriately to see initial events.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig19.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Various events which setup and start accelerator</i>
    </p>

	Note the time axis is in seconds. The first orange event (software) is the command being sent to the accelerator. The green bar indicates the accelerator being used.

	The second event is the wait for the dma to respond. The third, fourth and the fifth (software) events deal with the dma associated with input and output.

	The first blue event (rgb_2_gray_1_if:S_AXIS_FIFO_0[0]) indicates the actual data being transferred whereas the second blue event is when the output (rgb_2_gray_1_if:M_AXIS_FIFO_0[0])) has started. The time difference between the start of the input and start of the output would be the latency.

6. Click somewhere on the second blue event and then click on the next event button. Zoom out to see the desired view.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig20.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Tail end of the hardware accelerator events
</i>
    </p>

	As can be seen, the blue input (rgb_2_gray_1_if:S_AXIS_FIFO_0[0])) finishes first.

	The second blue (rgb_2_gray_1_if:M_AXIS_FIFO_0[0])) finishes next just after the green accelerator.

7. Click on the \*:color-wait[0] orange bar and then click the next event button to see the tail end activities. Zoom as necessary.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab4/Fig21.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Tail end of the transaction</i>
    </p>

	The orange output (_p0_rgb_2-gray_1_noasync:color-wait[0]) finishes followed by (_p0_rgb_2-gray_1_noasync:gray-wait[0]) indicating the completion of the execution.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you performed speedup estimation of an application running under Standalone OS and Linux OS, after targeting desired function for acceleration. Performance estimation does not require the full bitstream generation and it gives speedup estimate by looking at the performance report generated by HLS for each function targeted in hardware. Event tracing provides insight into how various events are taking place and the relative time spent in data movement and data processing.
