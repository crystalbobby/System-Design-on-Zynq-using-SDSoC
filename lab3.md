    </p>

1. Uncheck the **Generate SD card image** option
1. Select **Build Configurations \&gt; Set Active \&gt; Debug**
1. Right-click on **lab3** and select **Build Project**
This may take about five minutes as it is a pure software compilation.

## Profile the Application
### Connect the board in the JTAG mode and power it ON. Start the Debug session. Add the TCF Profiler view and configure it to include the Aggregate per Function option.
1. Connect the board in the JTAG mode and power it ON.
1. Right-click on the lab3 entry in the Project Explorer tab and select Debug As &gt; Launch on Hardware (SDx Application Debugger)

    <p align = "center">
	<i>Perspective Switch dialog window</i>
    </p>

1. Click **Yes** to open the debug perspective.

	The debug perspective will open showing various views: threads, variables, SDSoC_lab_design_main.c source program, Outline tab showing various objects created in the source program, and the console.

	Notice that the program is suspended at the main() entry on line 68.

    <p align = "center">
	<i>Opening the TCF Profiler configuration</i>
    </p>

	The Profiler Configuration window will open.

1. Leave _Aggregate per function_ selected, select the _Enable stack tracing_ option and click **OK**.

	The Aggregate per function option will group the same function calls collected together.

	The Enable stack tracking option implements thread stack back tracing - essentially a summary of how the program execution gets to where it is when sampled. This allows the determination of parent/child relationships between functions.

	The Max stack frames count field sets the number of frames to count backwards. This option is useful only if the Enable stack tracing is enabled.

	The View update interval (msec) field indicates at what interval the profile data will be updated in the TCF Profiler window.

	<i>Selecting the options</i>
    </p>

1. Click **OK**.
### Run the application and analyze the data.
1. Click on the Resume button (![alt tag](./images/lab3/resume_btn.png)) on the tool buttons bar or Press F8 to start the execution.

1. Note the number of collected samples may vary, when finished execution, depending on your PC's performance and connection speed with the board.

	<i>The TCF Profiler view showing the collected number of samples</i>
    </p>

1. Click on the Maximize view button (![alt tag](./images/lab3/maximize_btn.png)).

	Note that it shows three sections. The top-section shows various calls made after the execution started. The first function called is _start. In the Called From sub-window, nothing is listed as it the root function. In the Child Calls window, it shows main as the function being called from _start.

	<i>The TCF Profiler result</i>
    </p>

	Address is the location of the function in memory that will match whatis shown in the Disassembly view.

	% Exclusive is the percentage of samples encountered by the profiler for that function only (excluding samples of any child functions). This can also be exclusive percentage for that particular function.

	% Inclusive is the percentage of samples of a function, including samples collected during execution of any child functions.

	Function is the name of the function being sampled.

	File is the name of the file containing the function.

	Line indicates the line number where the function is found in the source file.

    <p align = "center">
	<i>Understanding exclusive vs inclusive execution time</i>
    </p>

	Exclusive: The amount of execution time spent in funA alone. Referencing the diagram below, the exclusive time for funA is represented by the combined execution time of the funA blocks only.

	Inclusive : The amount of execution time spent in funA and all of its sub-function calls. From the diagram, this is the exclusive time of funA combined with the hatched area during which time funB and funC are executing

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab3/Fig11.png" />
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
	<i>Various functions execution times (numbers may vary)</i>
    </p>

1. Note that _\_start_ and _main_ functions are 100% under the **%inclusive** column as all other functions are called from _main_. They are essentially 0% under the **%exclusive** column as a negligible time spent in those functions.
1. Looking under the **%inclusive** column, notice that the CPU spent about 40.3% of its time executing the _sharpen\_filter_ function and its sub-functions.
1. Click on the _sharpen\_filter_ entry to see that the source code window shows up.

	You can view the source code and see that it processes some data and calls several functions.

1. Switch back to the _TCF Profile_ result window and observe that the _sharpen\_filter_ function calls _sharpen\_operator, window\_shift\_right, linebuffer\_shift\_up, window\_insert , linebuffer\_getval,_ and _linebuffer\_insert\_bottom_ functions.

	The same Child Calls window shows how much time the CPU spent in each of those functions.

    </p>
    <p align = "center">
	<i>Child Calls from sharpen_filter function</i>
    </p>

1. Looking at the results sorted in the **%inclusive** column, we can see that _sharpen\_filter_ may be a good candidate for the hardware acceleration. The function and sub-functions should be carefully considered to determine suitability for acceleration. Typical candidates for acceleration are functions that can process a stream of data, or can be implemented in parallel, without excessive resource utilization.
1. Click on the **%Exclusive** column to sort the results.
You can see that the CPU spends a large proportion of the total time in the sharpen_operator function. This may be a good candidate for acceleration.

1. Click on the Disconnect button (![alt tag](./images/lab3/disconnect_btn.png)) to terminate the session.

## Accelerate sharpen_filter and Profile
### Add sharpen_filter function for hardware acceleration. Change SDSCC compiler setting to define TIME_SHARPEN symbol. Build the project and analyze the data motion network.
### Since this will take time to build, you will import lab3a project from the source\lab3 folder and then profile the application. The precompiled project has sharpen_filter already added for hardware with the compiler setting added.

Skip to 3-2 if you are continuing to build the project.

##Conclusion

In this lab, you profiled a pure software application which consist of three major functions. You saw the amount of time those three functions took to execute. Then you ported one of the most time-consuming function into hardware and profiled again. You then ported second most time-consuming function into hardware and profiled again and observed the performance improvement. You used the TCF profiler and sds_lib API to collect the data.
