## Conclusion

In this lab, you debugged Standalone and Linux applications using SDx software debugger. The Standalone application was debugged using JTAG connection whereas the Linux application was debugged over Ethernet. In Standalone application you were able to look into various arrays using the addresses and able to use the Dump/Restore Data File feature of SDSoC. In Linux application this was not possible as MMU translates the virtual addresses of arrays and pointers into physical addresses.
